	<p class="poem">I want my daddy back

			That’s all I ask for.

			To see him again 

			Hug him again.

			Have him with me.

			It’s been ten years and no sign of him

			No calls from him

			Why?

			Because he was deported after being in prison

			They took him away from me.

			He’s scared of crossing the border.

			He’s scared of prison.

			Will he ever come back?

			I want my daddy back.

			He’s the only one missing in the pictures.

			I’ve culminated from elementary

			I’ve culminated from middle school

			I’ve graduated from high school

			And I am determined to graduate from college  

			But will he be there? 

			Will he finally be in the picture?

			I want my daddy back.</p>

	<p>What A Perfect World.</p>


	<p class="poem">Perfection is impossible. 

		Just as traveling at the speed of light. 

		To truly be advertency 

		One must accept the emotional cascades. 

		Ride with the fluctuations of the currents. 

		Clog the seepage of doubt. 

		Let your perfect imperfections percolate your being. 

		No one is above you, the journey is endless.

		I know sometimes it’s hard and you can even feel helpless. 

		But we all need support. 

		Somebody to lean on.

		And if you take that first step,

		The isolation won’t be long. 

		People love to love you,

		They love to see you shine. 

		Accept patience and compassion because it’s always the right time.</p>

	<p class="poem">
		After spending years behind bars 
		
		A father returns to the life of his 
		
		daughter,with a jaw dropping response
		
		they are both greatful for the return 
		
		and bond that should have never
		
		been split.
		 
		A young child hurts and suffers more 

		with out the support and bond of a father.
		
		Yes ofcourse the choice of a father always 

		has to remain on the thought of losing time 

		with there child 
		
		But no child deserves to be with out the support

		 or father figured needed in life.
		
		Im happy to see they are both greatful and 

		full of excited surprised tears to see eachother.</p>
